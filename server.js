// and JSON parsing middleware,

// When in production (i.e., deployed, probably on Heroku),

// This is necessary because when creating a production build of a React app, 
// it compiles into static files that can be served by the express server.

//  middleware function that tells Express to serve static files from a directory named 'public' at the root level of the app.

// This router contains the other routing middleware (/api routes and possibly /auth routes).
// In other words, app.use(routes) imports the routes/index.js file.
app.use(routes);
// routes.initialize(app);

// Connect to the Mongo DB
// connect to the MongoDB database. 
// The app uses the MongoDB connection string from the environment variable MONGODB_URI if it exists (which it will in a deployed environment); 
// otherwise, it falls back to using a local MongoDB database at mongodb://localhost/inspiration.

});

// SUMMARY OF MIDDLEWARE IN server.js
// express.urlencoded({ extended: true })
// express.json()
// express.static("client/build")
// app.use(routes)

// some middleware (like router.post('/testing', ...) and 
// router.use("/api", apiRoutes)) might not be explicitly using the app.use() function, 
// but they're still middleware because they handle the request and response in the Express.js request-response cycle.

// In the context of an Express.js application, middleware is any function that has access to 
// the request object (req), the response object (res), and the next middleware function in the applicationâ€™s request-response cycle. 
// Middleware functions can perform a variety of tasks, including but not limited to:
// - Execute any code.
// - Make changes to the request and the response objects.
// - End the request-response cycle.
// - Call the next middleware in the stack.
// - In Express, middleware functions are invoked in sequence, and when invoked, they can either end the request/response cycle or call the next middleware in line.


/*
Term	            Description
Endpoint	        An endpoint refers to a specific URL where an API can be accessed. In a broader sense, it could also refer to a server, a service, or a database. In web development, it often refers to the part of the URL which comes after the base URL. For instance, in https://api.example.com/users, /users is an endpoint.

Path	            A path is the part of the URL that comes after the domain name. It usually refers to the directory or file on the server. For example, in https://example.com/blog/post1, /blog/post1 is the path. It is the specific location where a resource is stored.

Route	            A route is a definition of a URL pattern and the code to run when that URL pattern is matched. Routes connect URLs (or paths) to the logic that gets executed when a client makes a request to that URL. For instance, you may define a route in your application like app.get('/users', usersController.getAll) which means when a GET request is made to the /users URL, the getAll method of usersController is executed.

                  So, while there is overlap, these terms are not exactly synonymous. An endpoint is a specific URL where a service can be accessed, a path is the part of the URL indicating resource location, and a route is the mechanism to direct requests to different parts of your application based on the URL and HTTP verb.
